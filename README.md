Pearl Jam is a One Stop Digital Education Tool for Everyone developed during HackNITR

CHALLENGES ADDRESSED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are plenty of tools available online which are solely based on video lectures and tests.

1) Problem is they are very LONG. You can't take the crux out of them in seconds. You've to watch the videos as well as
articles to get the summary.
2) Second challenge is a significant number of Indian population find it understand to get english pronunciations. Sure, 
they can search for translations but not 'transliterations'.
3) Third challenge we addressed is we cater the need of visually impaired people by providing them audio of any topic. 
Moreover,even you can use this TTS tool.
4) We were trying our best to add an analytics dashboard in which you can enter your udemy/coursera credentials and then
we can give you your progress reports. However, due to lack of time we didn't focused on this. We made python scripts, it 
needs flask integration which can be done in a day.

As of now, this project is very functional. It has the potential to be scaled up which can help millions of underpriveleged
people.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TECHNOLOGIES USED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Python Backend
2. Flask
3. gTTS
4. indic_transliteration
5. Python essentials
6. JQuery
7. Frontend Essentials

We used this tech stack because of time constraints and easy scalability. It is very well possible to integrate AngularJS/
NodeJS
React Native to it. This will improve the scalability.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCALABILITY
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project is highly scalable. You can easily integrate regional language support in transliteration and text to speech
scripts (like Kannada, Bengali, Tamil). We've addedd 4 regional languages in tts. If its was a little bit longer hack,
we can smoothly add feature of local language transliteration too.

Moreover, this has a potential to help millions of people as it addresses India-specific challenges. It is helpful to 
you (if you're preparing for last-minute exams :p) or physically and economically priveledged people.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scope of Improvement
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Error Handling - you can't get summary for gibberish words. It needs to be addressed.
2. Improving Frontend - Frontend can be optimized (things like fonts and titles).
3. It can be made for heavy use by switching over to Django.
4. Regional Language Support can be easily added in the code.
